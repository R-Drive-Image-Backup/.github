## What is R-Drive Image?

**R-Drive Image** is an advanced utility providing disk image file creation for backup or duplication purposes. A disk image file contains the exact, byte-by-byte copy of a hard drive, partition, or logical disk and can be created with various compression levels on the fly without stopping Windows OS. These drive image files can then be transferred to various storage media such as CD-R(W)/DVD, Iomega Zip or Jazz disks, or another hard drive.

With R-Drive Image, users can:
- Create complete system backups for disaster recovery.
- Clone disks for upgrading to a larger drive.
- Restore systems after crashes or malware attacks.
- Schedule automatic backups to ensure data safety.

The software is widely used by IT professionals, system administrators, and home users who need reliable data protection. Its ability to work while Windows is running makes it exceptionally convenient for continuous system operation without downtime.

R-Drive Image supports all major file systems including FAT12, FAT16, FAT32, NTFS, NTFS5, NTFS/EFS, Linux Ext2, Ext3, Ext4, ReiserFS, and Apple HFS+ file systems. Whether you're protecting critical business data or personal files, R-Drive Image offers a comprehensive solution for all your backup needs.
